# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
UCSD bootcamp module 7

*Overview*

***Purpose***

The purpose of this analysis is to show Pewlett-Hackard who will be expected to retire as the "Silver Tsunami" approaches. By using SQL through pgAdmin to perform inquiries on our many .csv files, we can see in full detail who will be leaving the company. Furthermore, The company is interested in finding out which employees are eligible for the Mentorship program to train the replacements. By using the same process as the previous task, pgAdmin can display who is eligible based on certain criteria(s).

*Results*

***The take-away results from the two tasks at hand can be summarized in the following list:***

1. Majority of the staffs' titles are Senior, which is expected for people who have worked for a long time. Refer to diagram 1.

2. At least 70,000 employees will be leaving the company. That is a lot of vacancy spots to fill in, which could mean a lot of promotions are due. Refer to diagram 2.


3. There are many non-management roles that are expected to retire, however only two managers are leaving. Therefore, the data suggest that there are only a few manager to overseer thousands of employees or the management team consists of many younger employees. Refer to diagram 2.

*Summary*

***How many roles will need to be filled as the "Silver Tsunami" begins to make an impact?***

Referring to diagram 1, we can see that at least 70,000 employees are expected to retire from the company. That's a lot of employees to leave vacant spots. However, the company consists of at least 300,000 employees & therefore can fulfill their spots. Since this issue has been detected ahead of time, upper-management can begin to make plans as senior staff begin to retire. 

***Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?***

Referring to diagram 3, we can see that the there are roughly 1,500 employees who are capable of becoming mentors for the next generation of workers. This can be concerning as that would mean that each mentor has to handle roughly 47 people to effectively replace the ~70,000 vacant spots, assuming that all eligible candidates accept the role. Since that's beyond reasonable to request of the employees who are ready to let go of work, upper-management should consider implementing another method to train. 

***Are there enough people in management to handle the company after the "Silver Tsunami"?***

Based from diagram 2, we can see that there are only two managers who are retiring. That's less than 0.01% of the retiring employees. Based from the dept_manager.csv, there are a total of 24 managers that are overseering the entire company. Since only 2 of the 24 are retiring, that's not a significant loss of management & therefore the company can be expected to perform fine by only promoting two senior employees that are not due for retirement.
